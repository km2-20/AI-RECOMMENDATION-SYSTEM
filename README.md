*DESCRIPTION*:
The code implements a *user-based collaborative filtering recommender system* using Apache Mahout. It loads user-item preference data from a CSV file (`preferences.csv`), calculates *Pearson Correlation Similarity* between users, and generates recommendations based on the similarity of their preferences. The system uses a *UserNeighborhood* to find the nearest neighbors and a *UserBasedRecommender* to predict item ratings for a target user. For User 1, the system recommends item 103 with an estimated preference of 2.5, based on the ratings of User 2. The Maven build process compiles and runs the Java project, successfully loading the data, computing similarities, and outputting the recommendations.

The output provides a detailed recommendation for User 1, where the system estimates the rating for item 103 using the preferences of the most similar users. This showcases how collaborative filtering leverages the preferences of other users to predict items a user might like, even if they haven't rated them before.
